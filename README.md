Experimenting with a new Unit Testing framework
===============================================

UnitTesting is great but I don't love python's unittest.TestCase. It
feels awkward compared to Ruby's rspec and it also feels like it was
grafted from Java. I know that in Nose, there is no need to write a
class if you don't need a setup() or teardown() which is a nice
simplification. But I have another thing I often need when testing:
running a test with a set of inputs. I don't know a good way to do
this with unittest. Nose has a way but it seems awkward again. So
here's an attempt to re-think unittesting.


## A more complicated example
```python
class SodaFountain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.syrup = 10

    def pour(self, quantity):
        self.syrup -= quantity

# Our tests

from expectorant import describe, context, it, before

@describe("SodaFountain")
def _():
    soda_fountain = "X"

    @before
    def _():
        nonlocal soda_fountain
        soda_fountain = SodaFountain()

    @context("when one is already poured")
    def _():

        @before
        def _():
            soda_fountain.pour(1)

        def subject(val):
            soda_fountain.pour(val)

        @it("pouring another leaves 8 left")
        def _(expect):
            subject(1)
            expect.is_equal(soda_fountain.syrup, 8)

        @it("pouring 5 leaves 4 left")
        def _(expect):
            subject(5)
            expect.is_equal(soda_fountain.syrup, 4)
```


Let me know your thoughts--is this insane, am I missing an important use-case, what would be a nicer way to write tests?
