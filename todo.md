## Working on


## To Do

- write tests in Expectorant itself!

- use codec hack to hide `def _():`

- Handle exceptions within the spec
    - Make samples with exceptions in various places, e.g.
        - inside test that is not expecting it
        - inside setup
        - inside teardown
        - inside testing framework

- async tests



## Done
- better expect() syntax
- allow users to write new test functions easily
- check for side-effects to change
- check for raising exceptions
- install with pip
- better way to share values through test chain, e.g. pass a mutable 'self'
- proper test loader
- write in RSpec describe-context-it format
- decouple testing from reporting
